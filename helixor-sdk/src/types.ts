// THE COMPATIBILITY CONTRACT
// --------------------------
// The MVP's SDK exposed `getScore(agent) -> HealthScore`. Day 19 changes
// where that data comes FROM — the score now lives in an epoch-keyed
// HealthCertificate on the certificate-issuer program instead of a single
// overwritten account — but the SDK SHAPE does not change. Existing MVP
// consumers of `getScore` keep working without a code change.
//
// `HealthScore` below is exactly the MVP shape. New V2 capability (epoch
// history) is ADDITIVE — `getScoreHistory`, `getScoreAtEpoch` — never a
// breaking change to `getScore`.
// =============================================================================
